                                 ==================

This is the Firefox 2 frontend ported to RetroZilla. RetroZilla does not make official
releases of the browser at this time, however RetroZilla Browser builds and is branded. 
However,

                                YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN

Please do not submit bug reports to the RetroZilla project for issues encountered while
attempting to use or build RetroZilla Browser, unless you know how to and are willing to
submit a fix.

If you find a bug while using RetroZilla Browser that you suspect to be a layout (Gecko)
issue, please try to replicate it on the latest official release of the RetroZilla suite.
If the issue also affects the latest offical release, please bring it to our attention.

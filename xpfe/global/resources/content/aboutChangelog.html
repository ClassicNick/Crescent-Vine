		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
		<p>
			This should be our last major features-only and rebrand release. Starting with 3.0, we will upgrade
			the Gecko core to be more compliant for the modern web. We would like to thank the developers of the
			Crash Recovery and Session Manager extensions for a platform to build on for our new Session Restore
			feature. Users who already have any these extensions installed are advised to remove them.

<p style="font-size:18px; text-indent:72px;"><font color="blue"><b>Winternight-Classic is a 
web browser forked from RetroZilla 2.2, which itself was forked from Firefox 2.0 in 2015. 
Winternight-Classic's main goal is to provide as much compatibility with the modern web as possible, 
without sacrificing compatibility with old Windows versions, hence, why it has a Mozilla/Gecko 1.8.1
fork point. Winternight-Classic is compatibile with your computer as long as it meets these
requirements:
<br>i586 (Pentium) compatibile CPU (MMX and 500 MHz+ recommended)
<br>64 MB RAM (128-256 MB recommended)
<br>30-40 MB free hard disk space.
<br>Note: System requirements may be subject to change
(increase) as Winternight-Classic's rendering capabilities progress.
